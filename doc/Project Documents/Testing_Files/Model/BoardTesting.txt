Board()
Constructor
Create new array of arrays of Tile objects
Create new list of Player objects

movePossible(Robot, Tile)
int
Given Robot object and Tile object
if Robot has remaining movement equal to or greater than distance from current Tile to given Tile
	return difference between remaining movement and distance

attackPossible(Robot, Tile)
boolean
given Robot object and Tile object
if Robot range value is equal to or greater than distance from current Tile to given Tile
	and Tile contains a Robot
	return true
else return false

Testing:

//construct needed objects
Board() b
Robot() r1
Robot() r2
Tile() t1
Tile() t2

t1.x = 0
t1.y = 0
t1.addRobot(r1)
t1.addRobot(r2)

t2.x = 1
t2.y = 0

r1.movement = 1
r2.movement = 0
r1.location = t1
r2.location = t2

//Test movePossible
//should always happen
assert{
	b.movePossible(r1,t2) == 1
}
//should always never happen
assert{
	!b.movePossible(r2,t2)
}

//test attackPossible
assert{
	b.attackPossible(r1,t1) == true
	b.attackPossible(r1,t2) == false
}
