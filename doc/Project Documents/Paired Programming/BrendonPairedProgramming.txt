Brendon And Vigor
We met together to confront and solve an issue we were having with reading json files.
While we were working, we were able to explain ideas to each other much easier than we would be able to over text.
We were able to find out what problems we were facing and how to come up with a solution for our next work period.
We plan on having another session with each other once we have found a solution in the library documentation.

Brendon and Niklaas
We met to put together the code for our board class, and various other classes that were involved in it.
We were able to comminicate our ideas more clearly than we could before, and our undertanding of the program increased as a result.
We were able to effectively troubleshoot many problems we encountered with Eclipse and were able to devise a solution in only a few hours.
We plan to have more such sessions to continue building the system.
We accomplished more together than we may have working sperately because we would not have the second opinions of the other person to drive us along.
