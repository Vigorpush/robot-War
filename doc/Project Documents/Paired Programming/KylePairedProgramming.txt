	For my first paired programming session I worked with Nico Dimaano.  We decided to focus our session on the networking piece of the software.  I started out as the driver.  We quickly found some of the flaws with our design for the server class, and decided to break it up into two seperate classes, the client and the server.  We got quite a bit of work done.  As we worked through how the system would work, he helped me navigate around many errors that may have caused headaches later on.  After about an hour, we switched places.  I helped navigate through the code we had already written, and pointed out flaws in some of the logic we had come up with.  All in all, we got a tremendous amount of work done. In the two hours we allocated for this session, we had completed most of the fundamental functionality of the server and client features.  I would definately do this again.

	For my second session I worked with Niklass Neijmijer.  We decided to tackle to controller with our session.  We made a lot of progress with the functionality.  Because I had worked on the networking side, and he had done many of the view elements, we had a lot of good arguments about how to make the controller work well with both elements.  This was very productive, and together we sidestepped a lot of headaches that would have been caused by different understandings of how some of the functions should be implemented.  By combining our knowledge, I think we came up with the most effective solutions for the communications between the view, controller, and server.  This was again a very succesful session, and I woul definately do it again in the future.
