Robot Librarian Processor contains a list of Robots and four functions for modifying them.
The first is adding a robot to the list. This uses the list class's own adding functions as per choses implementation.
The remove robot function also uses the list's functions to remove a specific robot from the list permenantly.
Clearing the list removes all robots from the list in an identical manner.
The last function allows for the robot list to be returned as a full list to be manipulated by other exterior functions.
