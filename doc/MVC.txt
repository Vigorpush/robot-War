Pros
	1. Keeping the user interface changes completely separate from business logic. 
	 
	2. helps in easier maintenance of code.
		Business logic so code is clean and easy to maintenance

	3. Easier to test the business components, user interface 
	 
	4. More testable
 
 
 
 CONs
	1. More work which is mean that complex design
		Which needs good understand of control flows
 
 The pattern isolates ¡°domain logic¡± (the application logic for the user) from the user interface (input and presentation), permitting independent development, testing and maintenance of each (separation of concerns).
