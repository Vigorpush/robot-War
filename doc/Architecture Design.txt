	Reason is the server we will use which need be setted by prof
	But the last term, prof is not doing this, therefore, all the group just never do the networking stuff

	Reason is this data this game is small scale, which is mean that creating database will lose our energy 
	
	
Therefore, MVC should be the most reasonable architecture is this game software
